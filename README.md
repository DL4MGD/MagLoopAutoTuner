Automatic Tuner for stepmotor controlled magnetic loop antenna.

This project is intendet to crate an automatic tuner for stepper motor controlled magnetic loop antenna and to learn the programming the ARDUINO MEGA 2560. The code is far from beeing perfect also the hardware is almost rudimentary, but works almost fine. A new version with more accurate readings from the bidirectional coupler.
The schematic are not finished yet, but will be published if finished.
